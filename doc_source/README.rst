python-fedex documentation
==========================

This directory contains build scripts for python-fedex documentation
using epydoc 3.0.1. The following was used to generate doc:

    cd python-fedex/docs
    epydoc -v -o 2.X.X ../fedex/

The current documentation is hosted at https://pythonhosted.org/fedex/.
Sometime inn the near future, the plan is to move documentation over from
epydoc to sphinx, and host it on documentation at
http://python-fedex.readthedocs.org/.
